# Problem 1:  Two Sum

[](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)


## Input

* `nums`:  Array of integers
* `target`:  Integer

## Output

* Indices of two elements that sum to `target`
* Order of the two indices doesn't matter

## Constraints

* There is exactly one solution.
* Both numbers can't be the same element.
* 2 <= length of `nums` <= 10^4.
* -10^9 <= elements of `nums` <= 10^9.
* -10^9 <= `target` <= 10^9.

## Questions

* Can the array contain duplicates?
* If so, can the result return two elements with different indices but of the same value?

## Notes

* LeetCode's system must use 64-bit integers.
